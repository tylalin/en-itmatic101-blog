# Setting up AdGuard Home

AdGuard Home is alternative to Pi-Hole for network-wide Ad blocking but it has more capabilities for parental controls and some other additional features. I have been using Pi-Hole on my home server, Raspberry Pi, virtual machine and even Docker container at home network to stop the quite annoying ads pop-ups on my mobile devices and computers for some time. However, recently AdGuard Home has got my attention since I found out that OpenWRT can run AdGuard Home natively without requring any additional server. It has been a year now using AdGuard Home instead of Pi-Hole on my home network.
