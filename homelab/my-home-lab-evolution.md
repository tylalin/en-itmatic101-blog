# My Home Lab Evolution

It started with a humble beginning of a low-end Netgear 4 bays NAS, a Cyberoam UTM and a powerful (enough) PC which ran VMware Player/Workstation or Oracle Virtualbox hosting multiple VMs for some petty lab setups for Windows Active Directory and Exchange Mail Server on Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 Server evaluation. I vaguely remember that it was around the end of 2015. In prior to that, all of my home lab stuffs were on some kind of spared and old laptop. Probably I didn't lab much at all since it was quite an expensive hobby to own the enterprise hardware like servers, routers, switches and firewall. Well, I lived in a small bedroom at different boarding houses during those years so I didn't have much options for me.
